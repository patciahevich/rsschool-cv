### About Me
My age is thirty-one. Medical is my initial area of expertise. I completed my seven years of academic education and spent the next two years working as an outpatient clinic director and general doctor.  It was a great, challenging moment.  But I came to the realization that it is not my calling. And I began to consider switching careers. 

For the next three years, I took care of my child. And that's when I started attempting to learn JS on my own.

I think my age is a benefit that will help me launch a new profession rather than a drawback. And my expertise will support my future professional move.
